So let me begin by introducing myself. I am **Naseem Ali**,

![Applaud](applaud.gif)

*continued...* 

an undergrad at DIT University pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. I love sketching and basketball. I also have an interest in experimenting with technology. Sometimes I code, just to get the feeling that I am a Computer Science student. I live in Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India.

*Hope that's enough, anyway you are not going to post a letter on my address*

I was introduced to this world of code in year 2013 with the first language as Java. Earlier than that I only used to be a script kiddie. I felt so happy in copying and pasting those BAT files on the School PC. Showed them to my friends and thought **WOW** this is easy.

When I first started with Java I could not understand anything. 

So What? 

*I mugged up code* and tried writing it from memory the next day. But I failed as I forgot the syntax of Java If Else and wrote it like below
```java
if();{

}else{

}
```

I know **;** is not placed correctly. 

**So I mugged up really well this time** 

![LOL](laugh.gif)

and wrote the following code for a simple addition.
```java
public void add(int a, int b){
    int c = a+b;
    System.out.println(c);
}
```

I showed it to my friends and they thought **Naseem** know's how to code. I did not wanted to disappoint them.

**So I mugged up the whole book.**

And yes, that's how I started coding.
